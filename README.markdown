WHAT IS THIS FOR?

I wanted to learn a new language and Ruby is it. As a new
developer I badly needed a personal website, and so it was
a no brainer to create this site with RoR.

Who wrote this?

As listed at the top I followed along with the rails tutorial
book which was really helpful. Most of the application is
borrowed from the book and I am now starting t write my 
own application add-ons.
