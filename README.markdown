This project was written with help from:

* The Getting Started Guide: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html
* Ruby on Rails Tutorial Book: http://www.railstutorial.org/

A great guide to help get me started on Ruby on Rails!!!
I wanted to learn Ruby on Rails and build myself a website.
From here I would like to add more content about myself, 
and some cool add on applications. I posted up on Github
for others like me who want to learn.

==========================================================
OVERVIEW
-Built with TDD (rspec)

FEATURES
-MicroPosts (Twitteresque)
-Custom Authentication and Sessions
-Gravatar addition for signed up users
-BluePrint custom CSS
-Faker for autogeneration of test database

==========================================================
TDD

rspec uses spec files to hold your tests.

EXAMPLE: users_spec.rb

You can find them in the "/spec" folder. 
The bulk of the tests are for the Models and Controllers, 
but there are some integration tests which make sure that 
your pages and actions work as expected.
These are found in the "/spec/requests" folder.

==========================================================
Who wrote this?

As listed at the top I followed along with the rails tutorial
book which was really helpful. Most of the application is
borrowed from the book and I am now starting t write my 
own application add-ons.

More to come ...
